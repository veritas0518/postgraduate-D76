It's still as bad today as it was a few days ago. There's nothing to say. I don't know if yesterday's GitHub was uploaded. Now the computer can't connect to GitHub. Yesterday was really hard to say. It's really unlucky. When I joined this company, I was a little confused at the beginning of learning MySQL today. I'm much better later, but I still have a lot to learn. I have to prepare for the English exam and take it, There are so many things. I think this PTE can't be said to be difficult or simple. In fact, it's just cheating the machine. In a word, it's better than IELTS. IELTS is rated by people. Its fault tolerance is very unstable, but the machine is different. Its fault tolerance is very stable, so I just hope its AI recognition can't be enhanced. In that case, it can muddle through. It's really difficult. It's a good day.
